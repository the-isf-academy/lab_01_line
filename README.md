# Lab: Summarizing data with a line

In this lab, students will use build on their work with scatter plots to add a line of best fit to the plot.

We will evaluate our lines by calculating the mean square error of our lines.

## Jupyter Notebook Workflow

As a reminder, the workflow for using Jupyter notebooks with git is as follows:

* `git clone` or `git pull` the Jupyter notebook repo to your local directory
* run `jupyter notebook` in your working directory
* open the .Rmb file
* Save cmd+S the file
* Close and halt the .Rmb file
* Open the .ipynb file and edit as usual (this will save the output as usual while automatically updating the .Rmb file)
